      <p><br></br>Elizabeth Blackwell was the first female doctor in the United States of America. She started pursuing this
        career after being told by friends how humiliating seeing male doctors was. However, due to her gender she got
        rejected from many medical universities, except Genova Medical College in New York. Despite opposition from not
        only other students but also professors, Blackwell graduated at the top of her class in 1849. She was able to
        travel to Europe after earning her medical degree and perform many successful surgeries, until she contracted an
        eye disease causing her to lose sight in her left eye. This disease stopped Blackwell from being able to perform
        any more surgeries. However, she was able to start her own practice in New York as well as a women's medical
        school and two clinics for impoverished women and children.</p>

      Switzerland with her daughter Barbara they were transfixed by a window display of dolls in different ski outfits.
