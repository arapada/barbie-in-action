      <p class="bio">For me women’s rights are important because I want to represent and see change in our society. In
        our society it is obvious that women are undermined by men and do not always get the same opportunities due to
        gender. I hope to educate and spread awareness about the women’s rights movement and create change towards a
        bettered society.</p>

      <h3 class="name">Abigail Rapada</h3>
      <p class="bio">As a Filipina-American, I advocate for women's rights means to tackle patriarchy as it can be
        internalized beliefs that most youth are unaware of. I'm passionate about educating people of color about the
        cause of all problems within the American society and to decolonize our mindset by uplifting our cultural
        backgrounds :) </p>

      <h3 class="name">Yelena S.</h3>
      <p class="bio">Women's rights are incredibly important to me because they represent the fight for equality and
        justice for all women. I believe that every woman, regardless of her background or circumstances, should have
        the same opportunities and rights as men. I hope to challenge gender stereotypes, amplify marginalized voices,
        and contribute to creating a society where gender does not limit one's potential or determine one's worth. </p>
